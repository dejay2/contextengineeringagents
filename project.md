## Project Metadata
- **Project Name**: Context Engineering Framework
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Repository**: https://github.com/dejay2/contextengineeringagents
- **Classification**: Internal Tool/Framework
- **Primary Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Created**: 2025-01-15
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-16

## Overview and Goals

### Problem Statement
Development teams struggle with context loss, inadequate requirements capture, and inconsistent code quality throughout the development lifecycle. Traditional development approaches often lead to:
- Incomplete or ambiguous requirements
- Loss of context between development phases
- Inconsistent implementation patterns
- Inadequate testing and validation
- Poor documentation and knowledge transfer

### Project Goals
1. **Enforce Rigorous Requirements Capture**: Establish a systematic approach to capturing, documenting, and validating requirements before implementation
2. **Prevent Context Loss**: Maintain comprehensive context throughout the development lifecycle through structured documentation and agent handoffs
3. **Maintain Code Quality**: Implement automated validation gates and quality checks at every stage
4. **Standardize Development Workflow**: Create a repeatable, agent-driven workflow that scales across teams and projects
5. **Enable Efficient Handoffs**: Structure work so that any agent or team member can pick up where another left off

### Non-Goals
- Replace existing CI/CD pipelines (integrates with them)
- Provide runtime application monitoring (focuses on development workflow)
- Handle project management beyond task decomposition
- Manage team communications or meetings
- Replace version control systems

### Success Metrics
- **Context Retention**: 95% of requirements properly captured in structured formats
- **Implementation Success Rate**: 90% of PRPs implemented correctly on first pass
- **Code Quality**: 100% of deliverables pass all validation gates
- **Developer Productivity**: 30% reduction in rework due to unclear requirements
- **Knowledge Transfer**: New team members can contribute within 1 day using framework
